				<h1>"2nd and 3rd Conditional"</h1>
				<br><br>
				<h2>2nd Conditional</h2>
				<p>
					We us the Second Conditional when we want to talk about unreal or imaginary situations in the present.<br>
					Conditional sentences have two parts: an "if cause" and a "result clase".<br><br>
					Examples:
					if i were an animal, i would be a eagle.<br>
					i would go to the movies if my parents gave me permission.
					<br><br>
					we use past tense in the clase and would + infinitive in the result clause
					<br>
					was - informal<br>
					were - formal<br>
					<br>
			It is also possible to use other modals such as “could,” “might,” and “should”  in place of “would” in the 2nd conditional. Changing the modal changes the degree of certainty or the tone of the sentence, with “might” being not very sure, “could” being about 50/50 and “should” being used for making suggestions.
				</p>
				<h2>3rd Conditional</h2>
				<p>
					we use the third Conditional when we refer to unreal situations in the past (speculations or regrests).<br><br>
					if i <span id="color1">had found</span> her phone number, i <span id="color2">would have invited</span> her to the party.<br><br>
					that conditional setences have two parts: an <b>if Clause</b> and a <b>Result Clause.</b><br>
					The Clause goes in past perfect tense and the Result Clause uses would + have + verb in past participle.<br><br>
					if he had told me about your accident, i woulld have visited you in the hospital.<br>
					It is possible to use other modals such as “could,” “might,” and “should”  in place of “would” in the 3rd conditional as well. Changing the modal changes the degree of certainty, with “might” being not very sure, “could” being about 50/50 and “should” being very sure.
