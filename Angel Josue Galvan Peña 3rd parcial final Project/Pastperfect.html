				<h2>Past perfect</h2>
				<p>
					we use the past perfect tense to express an action taking pace before a certain time in the past or before another past action.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Structure: Subject + had + past parciple form of the verb + complement.
				<br><br>
				Example: John had studied sociology before he decided to study communication sciences.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "past perfect" refers to a time before the recent past. It is used to indicate that one event occurred before another in the past. It doesn't matter which event is mentioned first, because the tense makes clear the temporal order in which they occurred.
				</p>
				<p>
					also the past perfect have a negative and interrogative form here their structures:
				</p>
				<p>
					Negative<br>
					Subject + had not(hadn't) + past participle form of the verb + complement.<br>
					Example: they hadn't ordered a pizza before you arrived.
					<br><br>
					interrogative<br>
					Had + Subject + past participle form of the verb + complement + ?<br>
					Had you already eaten when i got home?
